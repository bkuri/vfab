## Performance Recommendations

### For v1.0.0 Release
1. ✅ **Core performance is solid** - Ready for production
2. ✅ **Memory usage is efficient** - No major leaks detected
3. ✅ **Import performance is acceptable** - CLI starts quickly

### Future Optimizations
1. **Implement lazy loading** for heavy CLI modules
2. **Add database query caching** for frequently accessed data
3. **Consider async operations** for I/O-intensive tasks
4. **Profile real workloads** for additional optimization opportunities

## Performance Status: ✅ READY

The ploTTY v0.9.0 codebase demonstrates excellent performance characteristics:
- Fast import times for responsive CLI
- Efficient memory usage patterns
- Well-structured database operations
- Proper error handling without performance penalties

**Ready for v1.0.0 production deployment.**
